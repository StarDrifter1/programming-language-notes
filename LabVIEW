Repositories & Libraries
------------------------
OpenG, as well as LAVA Code Repository (LAVAcr),
serve as repositories for a wide range of Open Source
LabVIEW applications and libraries. SourceForge has
LabVIEW listed as one of the possible languages in which
code can be written.

VI Package Manager has become the standard package
manager for LabVIEW libraries. It is very similar in purpose
to Ruby’s RubyGems and Perl’s CPAN, although it
provides a graphical user interface similar to the Synaptic
Package Manager. VI Package Manager provides access
to a repository of the OpenG (and other) libraries for LabVIEW.
Tools exist to convert MathML into G code.

National Instruments also offers a .NET framework compatible product for use with microsofts visual studio called: Measurement Studio
